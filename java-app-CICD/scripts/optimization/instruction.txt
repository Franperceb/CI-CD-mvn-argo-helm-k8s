 Kubernetes Log Analyzer - Usage Instructions

## Purpose
The purpose of this Python script is to analyze logs from Kubernetes pods and identify instances where a specified log pattern is present. It helps monitor and generate a report for logs that match a specific pattern, making it useful for various log analysis tasks.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- The `kubernetes` Python library installed. You can install it using pip:
- pip3 installed
- A valid Kubernetes configuration file. This should be configured with the necessary permissions to access the desired Kubernetes namespace and pods.

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure the following variables in the script:

- `log_directory`: Specify the path to the directory where the log analysis report will be saved. For example, "/path/to/logs".
- `log_pattern`: scripts/optimization$Define the specific log pattern you want to monitor for. This is the text or keyword that the script will search for in the logs.
- `namespace`: Set the Kubernetes namespace where you want to analyze logs. Modify it as per your requirements.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository that contains this script to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/Franperceb/CI-CD-mvn-argo-helm-k8s.git
    cd CI-CD-mvn-argo-helm-k8s

- A valid Kubernetes configuration file. This should be configured with the necessary permissions to access the desired Kubernetes namespace and pods.

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure the following variables in the script:

- `log_directory`: Specify the path to the directory where the log analysis report will be saved. For example, "/path/to/logs".
- `log_pattern`: Define the specific log pattern you want to monitor for. This is the text or keyword that the script will search for in the logs.
- `namespace`: Set the Kubernetes namespace where you want to analyze logs. Modify it as per your requirements.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository that contains this script to your local machine and go trough the directory:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd java-app-CICD/scripts/optimization

2. Edit the Python script to configure the variables as described in the "Configuration" section.

3. Run the script with the following command:
    python3 monitoring-pods.py

- The script will connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the loaded configuration.
- It will analyze logs from pods in the specified namespace.
- If logs matching the specified pattern are found, the script will generate a report.

4. Review the Log Analysis Report:
- The script will create a report in the `log_directory` with a timestamp indicating when the analysis was performed. The report will include details about the pods and containers where the log pattern was found.

5. Customize and Extend:
- You can customize the script further to meet your specific log analysis requirements or extend it for additional functionality.

Enjoy using the Kubernetes Log Analyzer to monitor logs and generate analysis reports!

## Problem Solved

This script helps to quickly identify logs within Kubernetes pods that match a specific pattern. It can be used for various purposes, including troubleshooting, monitoring, and auditing. By automating the log analysis process, it saves time and helps in identifying critical log entries efficiently.

# Future Implementations

In the future, you can consider enhancing the functionality of this script by automating log analysis using a cron job. Here's how you can implement it:

## Setting Up a Cron Job

1. Configure the script to run as a scheduled task using a cron job on your machine or server. You can set up a cron job to run the script at regular intervals (e.g., daily or hourly).

2. Use the following command to open the cron job configuration file for editing:
   
   crontab -e

3. Add an entry to the cron job file to specify when and how often you want the script to run. For example, to run the script every day at 3:00 PM, add the following line:

Replace `/usr/bin/python` with the path to your Python interpreter and `/path/to/script.py` with the actual path to the script.

4. Save and exit the cron job configuration file.

## Automation Benefits

Automating log analysis with a cron job offers several advantages:

- Continuous Monitoring: The script will run automatically at scheduled intervals, ensuring that log analysis is ongoing.

- Timely Alerts: You can set up email notifications or alerts to inform you when logs matching the pattern are found, enabling you to respond promptly to potential issues.

- Historical Data: Over time, the script will accumulate historical log analysis reports, allowing you to track changes and patterns in your logs.

Remember to periodically review and manage log analysis reports to maintain system health and security.

Enjoy the automated log analysis and monitoring benefits of running this script as a cron job in the future!
