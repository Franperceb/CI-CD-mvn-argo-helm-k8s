# Setting Up an End-to-End GitHub Actions Workflow for a Java Application


This document provides a step-by-step process to establish a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for a Java application. The workflow integrates various tools, including SonarQube, Helm, Kubernetes, and incorporates infrastructure as code with Terraform and configuration management for the SonarQube server. Ensure that you meet the following prerequisites before proceeding:

### Prerequisites
- **Java Application Code**: Your Java application's source code must be hosted on a Git repository.
- **GitHub Repository**: A GitHub repository is required to host your Java application's code.
- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions should be enabled for your repository.
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Access to a running Kubernetes cluster is necessary for deployment.
- **Helm Package Manager**: Helm should be installed and available for package management.
- **Terraform**: Terraform is required for creating and provisioning infrastructure as code, including an EC2 instance.
- **Ansible**: Ansible is used for configuration management and setup.


### GitHub Actions Workflow Steps
**Step 1: Checkout the repository**
- Check out the code from the GitHub repository, making it available for further build and deployment steps.
---
**Step 2:  Build with Maven**
 - Prepare the environment with the Java Development Kit (JDK) required for building the Java application.
- Build the Java application using Apache Maven. This step compiles the code and generates executable artifacts.
---
**Step 3:  Run JUnit Tests**
- Execute JUnit tests to ensure the quality and correctness of the Java application. This step validates that the application behaves as expected.
---
**Step 4:  Build and Push Docker Image**
-  Create a Docker image of the Java application and push it to a Docker registry. This step is essential for containerizing the application.

**Step 4:  Build and Push Docker Image**
-  Create a Docker image of the Java application and push it to a Docker registry. This step is essential for containerizing the application.
---- **Terraform**: Terraform is required for creating and provisioning infrastructure as code, including an EC2 instance.
- **Ansible**: Ansible is used for configuration management and setup.
**Step 5:  Deploys the App**
- Initialize Minikube, a tool for running a local Kubernetes cluster. This is required for deploying the application to a Kubernetes environment.
- Deploy the Java application to the Kubernetes cluster. This step involves making the application accessible within the cluster. (This part can be ommited if the deployment already exists on the kubernetes cluster and you only want to update)

---
**Step 6:   Verifying Deployment**
- Confirm that the Java application has been successfully deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. This step ensures that the application is running as expected.
 ---
**Step 7:   Verifying Deployment**
- Confirm that the Java application has been successfully deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. This step ensures that the application is running as expected.
 ---
**Step 8:  Updating Deployment**
-  If needed, update the deployment of the Java application in the Kubernetes cluster. This step is essential for making changes or improvements.
  ---
**Step 9:   Verifying Updated Deployment**
- Confirm that the updated deployment of the Java application in the Kubernetes cluster is successful. This ensures that the changes have been applied correctly.


This comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow automates the entire CI/CD process for a Java application. It encompasses everything from code retrieval to production deployment and leverages popular tools such as SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm, and Kubernetes.
